# Personal Developer Portfolio Site
This is my own personal website used to display and grow my skills in web developement and software engineering.

## About The Project 👨🏻‍💻
  &rarr; This project was built using the JavaScript web framework, Astro.  
  * Astro provided a component-based framework which provided versatility and adaptability to the project. This was important due to my desire to continously change and adapt this page to showcase my new skills and experiences as a developer.
  * Astro's support for multiple front-end frameworks made it easy to use a familiar framework like React.js to build my project.
    
  &rarr; Styling for the project was facilitated by Tailwind CSS  
  * Tailwind's seamless compatibility with Astro made it easy to create a cohesive and responsive design.
  * Plain CSS was also used as needed for component and in-line styling

  &rarr; Deploment through Netlify  
  * The site was deployed through Netlify due to it's ability to directly deploy from a GitHub Repository. This feature made the initial deployment quick and simple and it has the added benefit of making any future updates to the site just as quick and simple.
  * Netlify also has the added benefit of having a free tier which has been more than enough for an independent, personal project site.
